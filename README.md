# EspoCRM CVA Duplication Check - Extension

## About

This project is an EspoCRM extension for duplicate checking of cash distributions in Syria, based on Syrian National ID.
The settings are set up for Syria (e.g. currency is set to Syrian Pounds, timezone is set to Damascus, and National ID is set to 11 digits), but it can be adapted to other use cases where comparison can be done based solely on a National ID.

The software is based on [EspoCRM](https://www.espocrm.com/). Customisations have been made to EspoCRM by adding files to the code to meet the requirements of a CVA duplicate check system.
